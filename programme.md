<h2>Bio</h2>

Bernd T. Meyer received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Oldenburg, Germany, in 2009, where he was a member of the Medical Physics Group. He was a Visiting Researcher in the speech group with the International Computer Science Institute, Berkeley, CA, USA, and worked in the Center for Language and Speech Processing at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA. Since 2019, he is professor for Communication Acoustics at the University Oldenburg. His research interests include the relation of speech and hearing, with a special interest in models of human speech perception, automatic speech processing and its applications in hearing technology.
