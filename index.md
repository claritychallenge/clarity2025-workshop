We are now pleased to announce the <strong>6th Clarity Workshop for Improving Speech-in-Noise for Hearing Devices</strong>, to be collocated with Interspeech 2025, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. This will be an in-person Clarity event, following the format of the <a href="https://claritychallenge.org/clarity2023-workshop/">4th</a> Clarity workshop that was a satellite of Interspeech 2023.

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Understanding <strong>speech in the presence of background noise</strong> remains one of the most significant challenges for hearing-impaired listeners. <strong>Social noise levels</strong> can drastically reduce speech intelligibility, leading to isolation and reduced quality of life. With over <strong>360 million people worldwide</strong> affected by disabling hearing impairment, this issue is exacerbated by an <strong>aging population</strong>. While amplification devices restore audibility, they often fail to address the complexities of noisy environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recent advances in <strong>hearing aid devices</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> have opened the door to groundbreaking solutions. For example, advancements in <strong>low-power digital signal processors (DSPs)</strong> and <strong>edge AI hardware</strong> have equipped hearing aids with the ability to run simplified versions of deep learning models locally. Further, <strong>low energy wireless communication</strong> between hearing aids and mobile devices enables computationally demanding tasks to be offloaded, overcoming traditional power constraints. Techniques from <strong>statistical speech modeling</strong> and <strong>acoustic scene analysis</strong> can now be harnessed for hearing aid processing.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>Clarity Workshop</strong> provides a platform for collaboration between <strong>speech technologists</strong>, <strong>hearing researchers</strong>, and <strong>hearing aid developers</strong>. By fostering dialogue, we aim to inspire <strong>innovative approaches</strong> to addressing <strong>speech-in-noise challenges</strong> in real-world settings.

<h2>The 3rd Clarity Prediction Challenge</h2>

<p>
Clarity-2025 will host the 3rd Clarity Prediction Challenge, focused on developing innovative intrusive and non-intrusive methods for predicting hearing-aid speech intelligibility. The Challenge launches on 1st March. If youâ€™re interested in participating, please sign up for our Google group to receive further updates.
